# BISI-CST2208-W23-Project
Data Science python project
Instructions


Description:
 
Welcome to CST2208 Project. In this project, we aim to analyze diabetes data and address some important business problems/questions.
This project is focused on Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Training using Python.
A notebook is shared for the analysis.
Many parts of the solution notebook are omitted and replaced with questions. You are expected to fill in the gaps as per the instructions/questions.
Problem Statement:
Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.
A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis and building a classification Model.
Dataset Information:
Below is the attribute information:
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) test
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic)
Key Points to Note:
Please do not change the variable names to avoid hassles while executing the code.
The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential manner before submission. It is preferable to remove all warnings and errors before submission.
Save your Jupyter notebook as .ipynb along with the dataset on your Github repository and submit the link to your Github repository as a final submission.
The Github repository should have a readme file with details about the project.
The naming convention for the notebook will be firstname_studentID.ipynb
